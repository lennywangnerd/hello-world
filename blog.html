      <p>Today, it's my first time using Brackets. I hope it will prove to be an exciting experience.
     <p class="weird" style=”font-size:14px;font-weight:100;align=center;”> Brackets is made for html, and it's free! Html is a new skill for coding I learned in <a href=”http://www.codecademy.com” target=”_www.codeacademy.com”> codecademy.com. </a> I also downloaded Brackets, which is an absoulutely free!Today,I'm just making my blog. With the help of my ICT instructor Mrs.Tellez, I finally know how to have a preview of my blog!</p>

   <p style="font-style: oblique; padding-left: 1.5em; font-family: Chalkboard;">Hey. It's Lenny here, once again, to bore you to death with "How to Use HTML". So, you should go to <a href=”http://www.brackets.io” target=”_brackets.io”> brackets.io</a>. For now, we're having a couple of technical diffuculties, due to that I'm such a baffoon, you can't click the link. Anyways, you can download Brackets for free, which is basically the best thing about it.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Georgia; padding-left: 15px">Today, we kind of spent the first few minutes getting our stuff and listening to a fellow member's presentation, which was about 2D animation.I'm really tired today, and my head throbs today, so I'm not going to type that much. I'm still experimenting with brackets right now, so don't expect me to do consistent posts.<img src="images.png"border=”1px #000 solid” align=”right” /></p>

    <p>A long long time ago, where the amazing freaking Lenny lived, a explosion occured, which ironically, is the <em>totally</em>handsome guy who is telling the story. He had a freaking AK-47 and lived happily ever after.</p>

    <p>Hello! Today I get to torment little Vanessa, who is here for the first day! And freak, she has to sit by me, for reasons unexplained.</p>
    <p>Just my luck.</p>
    <p style="background-color: royalblue">So, Vanessa has been helping me choose colors and fonts. She's learning 2d animation, and she completly know nut. Just like her sensei, the Amazing **** ****(I think he won't like being named!**** is a very, how to say it, gosqis, interesting type of person. He has survived in Biba for many years, infuriating teacher after teacher each day, but he has never earned a trip to any principal's office.</p>

    <p>Velcome, and I haf transferred to a veird vay of typing, haf you noticed? I vant to learn dutch!Dutch is an extremely interesting thing to learn. Never mind.</p>
    <p style="font-family: HanziPen SC">So, this weekend was horrible! Oh, and for the people who are not at BIBA, I have Genius Club on Day B and E(BIBA does things like Monday through Friday is Day A through E, and next Monday is Day F, then Tuesday is Day A, the following Tuesday Day F, so on), so that's why I don't do consistent posts.
    <br/>
   So, why this weekend sucked: I had basketball training, which is so freaking tiring! But the good thing is that I had art class, and the teacher said I drew well, so she gave me, hmm, a 300ml coke, a Dove chocolate, and some chewing candy!SMirk</p>

       <p style="font-family: HanziPen SC;">Lol. Today I went on Taobao all day to create a budget for our chinese class, where we had a to buy stuff and cook stuff or make stuff and sell it. The school will loan us 200 RMB, with no interest, and we buy stuff. If we profit, we keep the profit; if we lose money, give whatever money is left back to the school.</p>
          <p style="font-family: HanziPen SC;">So, it will be fun!</p>
          <p style="font-family: HanziPen SC">In my group, there is All the boys+Vanessa, and the other team is all the girls-Vanessa. Please solve the algebra: (the boys+Vanessa)-(All the Girls-Vanessa)=x    What is x, if Girls=11 and Boys=7?</p>
          <p style="font-family: HanziPen SC">If it were up to me, I'll just split the 200RMB between us 8, no risk, so good!</p>
          <p style="font-family: HanziPen SC">I heard this in a youtube video once:Pay to win! GG! I am the weirdo, Lenny Wang, this is Lenny Wang from class 6M signing off.</p>
